# Rapid API Demo

Rapid JavaScript development environment for building RESTful API (Demo).

**Note:** This demo was originally created to be used along with [this environment](https://github.com/nuotron/rapid-api).

## Getting Started

Clone the original environment,
then clone this demo and replace the `api` directory.

**Note:** Access URL will be: `localhost:3000/book`.

**Note:** The available API methods are: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`.

## Todos:
1. Improve controller crud methods (Maybe move everything to model?).
2. Improve search query in controller.
4. controller should use the reveling module pattern to have all helpers inside scope.
